ID: 1, Text: INTRODUCTION - This section introduces the eBook “Principles of electricity.” It contains the title page, author information, release date, language, and publication details. These introductory paragraphs give the reader a general overview and set the stage for the technical content that follows....
ID: 2, Text: “WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?” - This chapter explores electricity's fundamental nature, tracing historical inquiries from Thales' observations of amber to modern energy-based definitions. It questions whether electricity is a distinct entity or a manifestation of energy, paralleling debates about matter. The electron theory is introduced, highlighting electricity as energy's effect on human senses. The chapter dismisses the ether hypothesis, asserting energy as the primary reality. Scientists like Steinmetz argue energy is the sole perceptible entity, with electricity being its observable effect. The conclusion posits electricity as energy in motion, focusing on its actions rather than intrinsic nature, setting the stage for practical applications in subsequent chapters....
ID: 3, Text: “MAGNETIC PHENOMENA” - Gilbert’s groundbreaking work in 1600 established Earth as a giant magnet, explaining compass behavior. The chapter details magnetic poles, their geographic mismatch, and shifting positions over centuries. Magnetic dip variations and solar influences on Earth’s magnetism are discussed, alongside experiments with lodestones and electromagnets. It emphasizes the dynamic nature of Earth’s magnetic field and its industrial applications, such as telegraphy. The link between solar activity (sunspots) and magnetic disturbances underscores the interconnectedness of cosmic and terrestrial phenomena, bridging ancient observations with modern geophysical studies....
ID: 4, Text: “PIONEERS IN ELECTROMAGNETIC THEORY” - Orsted’s 1820 discovery linking electricity and magnetism revolutionized physics, showing currents deflect compass needles. Faraday’s induction experiments revealed how moving magnets generate electricity, foundational for dynamos. Ampère’s laws quantified current interactions, conceptualizing molecular currents akin to electrons. Cavendish and Coulomb’s inverse-square laws framed electrostatic forces, while later experiments (Einstein, Kamerlingh-Onnes) validated electron motion. The chapter underscores collaborative progress from speculative theories to quantifiable principles, enabling technologies like motors and generators, and highlights unresolved questions about resistance and perpetual currents at absolute zero....
ID: 5, Text: “THEORIES OF ELECTRICITY” - Static and current electricity are contrasted, with Franklin’s one-fluid theory versus Dufay’s two-fluid model. Volta’s battery demonstrated chemical-to-electrical energy conversion, while electrolysis linked currents to atomic dissociation. The evolution from fluid analogies to electron theory is traced, emphasizing Thomson’s corpuscular model. Terms like anode/cathode and dielectric strength are explained, alongside debates over action-at-a-distance versus field theories. The chapter concludes with Soddy’s reflection on unresolved questions about electricity’s essence, illustrating how theoretical shifts mirror broader scientific revolutions....
ID: 6, Text: “MODERN MAGNETIC THEORY” - This chapter connects magnetism to intra-atomic energy, explaining dynamos as converters of mechanical motion into electricity via electron flow. Steinmetz and Le Bon propose that magnetism harnesses atoms’ latent energy, with Earth’s field acting as an infinite reservoir. The staggering energy potential within matter (e.g., a pound of soil equaling a million tons of dynamite) highlights untapped atomic power. Ethical concerns about harnessing such energy conclude the chapter, warning of catastrophic misuse if controlled prematurely, while celebrating magnetism’s role in sustainable energy systems....
ID: 7, Text: “PROOF THAT ELECTRONS ARE ATOMS OF ELECTRICITY” - The Zeeman and Stark effects demonstrate electrons’ existence: magnetic/electric fields split spectral lines, revealing charged particles’ motion. Lorentz’s predictions align with Zeeman’s measurements, calculating electron mass. Stark’s electric field experiments further confirm electron influence on light. Applications in astronomy (sunspot magnetism, solar polarity) validate these effects’ universality. Hale’s solar studies, using powerful spectroscopes, show stars as magnets, linking cosmic and atomic scales. The chapter affirms electrons as electricity’s fundamental units, bridging lab experiments and cosmic phenomena, while hinting at quantum theory’s future role in explaining these effects....
