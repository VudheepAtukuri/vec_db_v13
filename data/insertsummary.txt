CHAPTER 7 - “THE DISCOVERY OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY” - This chapter traces the evolution of wireless communication from Faraday’s foundational electromagnetic research to Maxwell’s theoretical unification of light and electromagnetism. Hertz’s experiments validated Maxwell’s predictions, generating and detecting radio waves, proving their light-like properties (speed, reflection, polarization) and measuring their wavelengths. Marconi, leveraging Lodge’s coherer and Righi’s innovations, achieved transatlantic wireless transmission by 1902. Advances like vacuum tubes and Heising’s modulation system enabled radio telephony, revolutionizing global communication. Steinmetz and Tesla speculated on radio’s future—wireless power transmission, transcontinental communication, and even interplanetary signals. The chapter underscores how theoretical curiosity (Faraday, Maxwell) birthed transformative technologies, with Hertzian waves bridging lab science to modern radio, aviation, and visionary applications like energy transmission and cosmic exploration.
